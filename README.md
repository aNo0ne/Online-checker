# Online-checker

This code is a script that allows users to check the status (online or offline) of a list of domains or IP addresses. 
It uses the ping command to send a single ICMP echo request to each domain or IP address. 
The script prompts the user to choose between executing with saved domains or editing the list. 
It validates the domains entered by the user to ensure they are valid. The list of domains is saved to a file for future use. 
The script displays a table with the domains and their corresponding status. 
Online domains are displayed in green, offline domains in red, and invalid domains are marked as "Invalid". 
The script uses the socket module to resolve domain names to IP addresses. 
It utilizes the subprocess module to execute the ping command and captures the output. 
The script utilizes ANSI escape codes for colored output in the terminal.
